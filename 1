Based on the information in your repository's README file, the pre-screening assignment involves setting up a full-stack application with frontend and backend components, alongside a PostgreSQL database, using Docker. 

**Here's a step-by-step guide to deploy the application:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/va2pt/pre-screening-assignment.git
   cd pre-screening-assignment
   ```


2. **Create a New Branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b solutions-{your-name}
   ```


3. **Navigate to the Assignment Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd assignment
   ```


4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `assignment` directory with the necessary environment variables for the services to run properly. Ensure you include all required variables as specified in the project documentation.

5. **Build and Run the Docker Containers:**

   Use Docker Compose to build and start all services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```


   This command will build the Docker images for the frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL services and start them.

6. **Verify the Deployment:**

   - **Backend:** Access the backend service at `http://localhost:8000` (or the configured port).

   - **Frontend:** Access the frontend service at `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port).

   Ensure both services are running correctly and can communicate with each other and the PostgreSQL database.

7. **Troubleshooting:**

   - Check the logs of each service for any errors:

     ```bash
     docker-compose logs {service-name}
     ```

   - Ensure that the environment variables in the `.env` file are correctly set.

   - Verify that the Docker images are built without errors and that the containers are running.

By following these steps, you should be able to deploy the full-stack application as outlined in the pre-screening assignment.
